# Font Files

This directory contains font files for 3D text rendering.

## helvetiker_regular.typeface.json

This is a Three.js compatible font file for 3D text rendering. In a production environment, you would download this from:
https://threejs.org/examples/fonts/helvetiker_regular.typeface.json

Or convert your own font using:
https://gero3.github.io/facetype.js/

For now, the component includes fallback handling when the font file is not available.
