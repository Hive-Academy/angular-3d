## Tips for Better Discovery

1. **Don't skip the metaphor**: "Egyptian sacred tech" guided every Ptah design decision
2. **Be specific with references**: "I like Stripe" → "I like Stripe's gradient use in their hero"
3. **Contradictions are okay**: "Professional but playful" is a valid tension to design around
4. **Screenshots help**: Capture specific elements you like, not just full pages
5. **Name it**: Give your aesthetic a memorable name for future reference
