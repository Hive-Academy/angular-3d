# Task Context - TASK_2026_005

## User Intent

Two Angular open-source libraries (@hive-academy/angular-3d and @hive-academy/angular-gsap) are ready for publishing. The user is concerned about:

1. **Documentation Quality** - Current README.md and CLAUDE.md files need improvement
2. **Documentation Framework** - No proper documentation framework or custom docs site integrated
3. **First-Time Open Source** - User needs guidance on open-source library release best practices

User's exact request: "now these 2 packages are 2 open source libraries for angular, so far we have made examples usage in our demo application, and i think we are ready to publish both of them, but i found out our documentation is not that great specially our readme and claude.md files, and also we didn't integrate or setup any proper docmentation framwork or build one oursleves, so i want your help into figuring out how best we should handle that, as well as for me this is considered to be my first open source libraries and i'm not sure what is the next step from here on out so help me with that as well please"

## Current State Analysis

### Documentation Status

- **angular-3d README.md**: ~145 lines, covers installation + animation directives only (incomplete API coverage)
- **angular-gsap README.md**: ~450 lines, comprehensive coverage with examples (good quality)
- **CLAUDE.md files**: Developer-focused internal docs, not user-facing
- **Root README.md**: Default Nx template + publishing info (not library-focused)

### What's Missing

1. No documentation website (Storybook, Docusaurus, Compodoc)
2. angular-3d README lacks coverage for: Scene3d, primitives (Box, Cylinder, etc.), lights, controls, postprocessing
3. No CONTRIBUTING.md
4. No CHANGELOG.md (will be auto-generated by Nx release)
5. No GitHub templates (issue/PR templates)
6. No CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
7. No live demo link in READMEs
8. No badges (npm version, build status, license)

### Existing Infrastructure

- Nx release tooling configured (TASK_2025_027 completed)
- GitHub Actions for publishing
- Conventional commits enforced
- Demo app exists at apps/angular-3d-demo

## Conversation Summary

This is a new task. User is preparing for first public release of two Angular libraries.

## Technical Context

- Branch: feature/TASK_2025_028-webgpu-migration (current, clean state)
- Created: 2026-01-06
- Type: DOCUMENTATION + RESEARCH (guidance needed)
- Complexity: Medium

## Execution Strategy

This is a DOCUMENTATION + RESEARCH hybrid task:

1. Research - Investigate best practices for Angular open-source library releases
2. PM - Define comprehensive documentation and release requirements
3. Architect - Design documentation strategy (framework choice, structure)
4. Implementation - Create/improve documentation
5. Style Review - Ensure consistency
